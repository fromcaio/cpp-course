    "* **03 — Practice:** Bootloader exercise using FetchContent (nlohmann/json) with a preset-driven build in `practice/`.\n",

    "* **Tight feedback loop:** Cells act like a REPL—great for language features, STL exploration, and small experiments.\n",
    "* **Teaching clarity:** We can interleave narrative, tables, and runnable code to highlight differences from C.\n",

    "But notebooks stop being enough once you: \n",

    "* Pull real dependencies (fmt, nlohmann/json, etc.).\n",
    "* Care about compiler flags, warnings, sanitizers, or platform builds.\n",
    "* Want tooling support: IntelliSense from `compile_commands.json`, debugging, formatting, tests."

    "## 🏗️ Why we move to CMake + presets\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Reproducibility:** Presets capture generator, build dir, and flags so everyone (and CI) builds the same way.\n",
    "* **Tooling integration:** VS Code CMake Tools, clangd, and linters read `compile_commands.json` from the build dir.\n",
    "* **Dependencies:** FetchContent/Conan/vcpkg hook naturally into CMake.\n",
    "* **Scalability:** Real projects need out-of-source builds, target properties, and proper link interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tradeoff: a bit more upfront configuration (CMakeLists, CMakePresets, editor settings). We keep presets minimal in this course so you can focus on the code while still learning the professional workflow."

    "2) **Build** with `make -C build/default` (or `CMake: Build` in VS Code).\n",
    "3) **Run/Debug** the target (ensure any data files like `config.json` are in the working directory).\n",
