    "* **Reproducibility:** Presets capture generator, build dir, and flags so everyone (and CI) builds the same way.\n",
    "* **Tooling integration:** VS Code CMake Tools, clangd, and linters read `compile_commands.json` from the build dir.\n",

    "* **Scalability:** Real projects need out-of-source builds, target properties, and proper link interfaces.\n",
