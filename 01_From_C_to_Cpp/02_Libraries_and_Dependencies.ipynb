    "\n",

    "### Strategy A: The System Package Manager (Linux Style)\n",
    "You rely on your OS.\n",
    "bash\n",
    "sudo apt-get install libfmt-dev\n",
    "\n",
    "Then in CMake:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cmake\n",
    "find_package(fmt REQUIRED)\n",
    "target_link_libraries(myapp fmt::fmt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Pros: Easy on Linux.\n",
    "* Cons: Nightmare on Windows; you don't control the version (you get whatever Ubuntu gives you).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy B: Vendoring (git submodule)\n",
    "You literally download the library source code into a libs/ folder in your project.\n",
    "* Pros: You control everything. Zero external dependencies.\n",
    "* Cons: Your repository gets huge. You have to manually update libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy C: Modern CMake (FetchContent)\n",
    "This is the modern standard for small to medium projects. CMake can download libraries while compiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example CMakeLists.txt:\n",
    "```cmake\n",
    "include(FetchContent)\n",
    "\n",
    "FetchContent_Declare(\n",
    "  fmt\n",
    "  GIT_REPOSITORY [https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)\n",
    "  GIT_TAG        10.1.0\n",
    ")\n",
    "\n",
    "FetchContent_MakeAvailable(fmt)\n",
    "\n",
    "add_executable(app main.cpp)\n",
    "target_link_libraries(app fmt::fmt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy D: The \"New\" Package Managers (Conan / vcpkg)\n",
    "These are the closest things to pip. They are command-line tools that install libraries into a central cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "vcpkg install fmt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These are great for large enterprise projects, but FetchContent (Strategy C) is often enough for personal projects."
